# Processing Geographical Data in QGIS
This repo contains the material connected to the Processing Geographical Data in QGis training
The workshop was created for CDCS by **Ki Tong**. 
This workshop focuses on how to manage and process geospatial data for analysis. 

The workshop covers the techniques for manipulating geospatial data using QGIS and visualising the results of geo-processing.
The slides introduce the concept of geoprocessing, including its common types and how it is applied within the QGIS platform. 
There are also practical exercises using real-world data, which aim to teach students how to manipulate geospatial data to align with their research objectives and perform various descriptive and statistical analyses.

## How to use this repository 

This repository includes datasets and guidelines for conducting practical exercises, all contained in a zipped folder titled 'Geoprocessing.' 
To use the material you will need to download and unzip the file.

**N.B** The zipped file is quite large (**more than 2 GB**) so you need to make sure to have enough space on your laptop before downloading and unzipping it.
